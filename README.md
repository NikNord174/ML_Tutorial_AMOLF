# Tutorial for ML community at AMOLF
This repository is aimed to show the simpliest training process of Neural Networks using PyTorch.

## Quick start

### For Mac users:

1. Create and activate an environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install requirements
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. To start training
```
python3 main.py
```
or go to step-by-step.ipynb for more detailed description of training process.

### For Windows users:

1. Create and activate an environment
```
py -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
```
2. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. To start training
```
py main.py
```
or go to step-by-step.ipynb for more detailed description of training process.

## Experiment with different models or hyperparameters
To try training process with different model change model argument in main.py.
Other hyperparameters are available in constants.py.
